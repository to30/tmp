Python bindings to the Heat orchestration API
=============================================

This is a client library for Heat built on the Heat orchestration API. It
provides a Python API (the ``heatclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``heat``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`developer guide <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.  The master
repository is in `Git <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/heat-api/python-heatclient>`_.

See release notes and more at `<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-heatclient/>`_.
